# Introduction
Get a jump-start on making your AltspaceVR hologram app.
Get your 3D model into Altspace & 2D browsers at the same time and start manipulating it with just a few lines of code.

There are usage instructions in the source code.  This handles all of the legwork of setting stuff up and lets you get straight to prototyping your hologram AltspaceVR app.

It currently handles scene setup, model pre-caching, scene-wide animation, and per-object animation.

Since it works directly on scene objects themselves, the code you generate using it is very forward-compatible.

It also exposes all important scene-related objects as global variables, so you are not restricting yourself by using it.

# Instructions (EASY MODE)
1. Clone the repo, then use index.html as the starting point of your project.
