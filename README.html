<p>Get a jump-start on making your AltspaceVR hologram app.
Get your 3D model into Altspace &amp; 2D browsers at the same time and start manipulating it with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>There are usage instructions in the source code.  This handles all of the legwork of setting stuff up and lets you get straight to prototyping your hologram AltspaceVR app.</p>
<p>It currently handles scene setup, model pre-caching, scene-wide animation, and per-object animation.</p>
<p>Since it works directly on scene objects themselves, the code you generate using it is very forward-compatible.</p>
<p>It also exposes all important scene-related objects as global variables, so you are not restricting yourself by using it.</p>
